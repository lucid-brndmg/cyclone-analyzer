# Cyclone Analyzer

Cyclone analyzer is a semantic analyzer & type checker of the [Cyclone Specification Language](https://classicwuhao.github.io/cyclone_tutorial/tutorial-content.html). 

The analyzer covers most of Cyclone's language features. This package also contains the language specification, an IR builder, some utility functions, a parser and a lexer based on ANTLR4 for Cyclone. This package is a dependency of the [cyclone online editor](https://github.com/lucid-brndmg/cyclone-online-editor) project.

*This project is a part of my final year project (CS440[A]) at Maynooth University.*

## TODO

- Use Flow to do type checking for some modules. (This project has no intention to rewrite in typescript for now)
- This document is unfinished and will be updated in the future.
